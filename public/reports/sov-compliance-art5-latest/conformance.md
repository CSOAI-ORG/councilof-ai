# sov-compliance-art5:latest × conformance — UNMEASURED

Measurement, not certification. This report is derived from signed cards; it is not a grade, rank, conformity mark or legal determination. Measurement, not certification; verification is free.

| field | value |
|---|---|
| axis | `conformance` (model-comparison) |
| subject | `sov-compliance-art5:latest` |
| status | **UNMEASURED** |
| reason | source card carries no n: accuracy is a single point on one small bank on one date, and the card does not state a sample size, so nothing here may read MEASURED |
| n | 0 bank items |
| separation | UNTESTED |
| rows | 0 (the source card publishes no per-item rows) |

## Verify

Each source card verifies offline with `/signed/verify-card.mjs` (id recomputed, Ed25519 checked under the pinned key). canonical_sha256 = sha256(canonical JSON of this object minus generated_at and canonical_sha256; keys sorted, no whitespace)
