# sov-refusal-combo:latest × governance — UNMEASURED

Measurement, not certification. This report is derived from signed cards; it is not a grade, rank, conformity mark or legal determination. Measurement, not certification; verification is free.

| field | value |

| axis | `governance` (model-comparison) |
| subject | `sov-refusal-combo:latest` |

| n | 0 bank items |
| separation | UNTESTED |
| rows | 0 (the source card publishes no per-item rows) |
